      My present academic and research interests are the offspring of a number of exceptional experiences, academic as well as personal. I have enumerated my key projects here.

 Computers surpass humans in terms of both speed and accuracy at mathematical calculations. Yet, it remains an unaccomplished challenge for a computer to understand simple arithmetic word problems posed in the natural language. The ISolveMath group is striving to develop a system that can solve arithmetic problems.  I urge everyone, especially the readers with a childhood fear of maths, to check explore our present system<a href="http://isolvemath.tech/"> here</a>. Academicians may view our code on GitHub. A <a href="http://aclweb.org/anthology/I17-3017">paper</a> has also been published in IJCNLP-2017.<br>
This project has served as a launchpad for my wild imagination; my brain conjuring up ways in which learning and tutoring could be made fun and effective. We are now aspiring to make the system more generic through the implementation of deep learning and machine translation. In the future, we hope to develop an interactive platform with cartoon characters explaining the answers to questions. <br> 
Our group comprises of individuals with distinctive backgrounds and skill sets. We collaborate while studying in different cities and colleges. Besides the rigorous training in theoretical and applied computer science that I received, working with such a diverse and motivated group has been a highlight of this wonderful experience. Though Maths remained my favorite subject throughout my childhood, I envision learning with "Tom and Jerry" or "Scooby Doo" would have made it even more enjoyable for me.

 <a href="http://bodhitree.cse.iitb.ac.in/accounts/login/">Bodhitree</a> aims to accomplish an accessible quality technical education for all, through personalized, flexible, and hands­-on complete learning. It is based on the innovator Benjamin Franklin's saying "Tell me and I forget, teach me and I may remember, involve me and I learn". I came across this online teaching portal through the internet. I was intrigued by the concept.  Realising that the front-end was still in the development phase, I contacted Professor kameswari heading the project. Working under the expert guidance of the project staff and Professor Kameswari has been an enriching experience. On one hand, there is a statistical aspect in analyzing the assignment and exam grades, and devising a lucid representation to present this data to the students. On the other hand, there is a psychological aspect in finding a comprehensible organization of lecture videos, quizzes, and other content. I cherish the little impact I have created through my work. I realize that the future of our country's education lies in systems such as DILTON and My Bodhitree.

Whilst at IIT Bombay I have also participated in <b>the Inter-IIT Tech Meet 2018 </b>. I was the only freshman in IIT Bomaby's contingent. We developed an <b> Autonomous Toilet Cleaning Bot </b>. Besides these projects, I have also interned at a startup <b>BlueSemiconductors </b>, Hyderabad as their web and software developer in Summer 2017.
