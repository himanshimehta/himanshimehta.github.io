<!-- <b style="font-size: 1.3em;">Who am I?</b><br>
	<p > -->
Hi there! I am Himanshi Mehta, an undergraduate majoring in <b>Data Science</b> at <b>Purdue University, USA</b>. I am a transfer student at Purdue from <b>IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India</b> where I studied Electrical Engineering in my first year. I hail from the beautiful city of lakes: Udaipur, Rajasthan.</p>

<p>
<!-- <b style="font-size: 1.3em;"> What am I interested in?</b>  -->
I am interested in machine learning and theoretical computer science. I have worked on a number of projects that are listed on my résumé. 
<br>
I am excited to be interning at <b> Salesforce, San Francisco, California </b> this summer with the Sales Cloud Einstein team!
<br> Summer '18 I interned at <b> Saarland University, Germany </b>in the Computational Linguistics department under Prof. Dr. Vera Demberg.
<br>
Please see my <a href="CV.pdf">résumé </a> for details. 
<!-- <br>
<b>Are Artificial Intelligence and Technology the Dawn or the Demise?</b> As of now, we aren't in a position to provide a well-founded answer. But as ideas of visionaries like Elon Musk become less science fiction and more grounded in reality day by day, one thing is for certain: AI and Tech definitely make up our future. 
<br>
This thought drives me to learn and contribute to this BOOM. I am lucky enough to have been born in this perplexing era of computers and artificial intelligence.
 <br> </p>
<hr>
 <b style="font-size: 1.3em;">What have I worked on? </b>
 <br>
 With immense vigour, I have worked on a number of interesting projects related to educational technology, development, and personal interests. Learn <a href="write.html">more</a> about them.<br>

 <hr>
 
 <b style="font-size: 1.3em;">What invigorates me?</b>
 <br> -->
<!-- 
 My favorite leisure activities are badminton and novels. I am a voracious reader of paperbacks and a national-level badminton player. I am fortunate to have found my lifetime passions - badminton and reading at a very young age. Naturally, both were a grand part of my childhood and growing up. While novels of Leo Tolstoy and Harry Potter transported me to a faraway magical world, badminton became my link to the real world. Over the years the struggle of playing competitively in a male-dominated field has helped me realize my feminity and the responsibilities that came with it.<br>
 <br>


  <b>Conclusively, --> <!-- I identify myself as a "thinker" and love science, badminton, and books. I love playing games and conducting "thought experiments" on people's actions and motivations. -->
