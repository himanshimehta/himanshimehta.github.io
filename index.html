<div style="font-size:1.2em;	line-height:35px;text-align: left;">
<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">Who am I?</b><br>
	<p >
Hi there! I am Himanshi Mehta, an undergraduate majoring in Data Science at Purdue Univeristy, West Lafayette, USA. I am a transfer student from IIT Bombay, Mumbai, India. I hail from Udaipur (Rajasthan), a city with variegated people, colossal palaces, and brimming lakes. This site list outdated projects. <b>See my CV for the recent ones!</b></p>
<hr>

<b style="font-size: 1.3em;">
What am I interested in?</b> <br>
<p>
Curious by construction, a plethora of topics ranging from discrete math to cognitive psychology interest me. I am enthralled by the amazing world conjured up by the interplay of computer science, education science, and psychology. I sincerely believe that recent technological advances and the ones yet to come have the capacity of changing the face of pedagogy and the society at large.
<br>
<b>Are Artificial Intelligence and Technology the Dawn or the Demise?</b> As of now, we aren't in a position to provide a well-founded answer. But as ideas of visionaries like Elon Musk become less science fiction and more grounded in reality day by day, one thing is for certain: AI and Tech definitely make up our future. 
<br>
This thought drives me to learn and contribute to this BOOM. I am lucky enough to have been born in this perplexing era of computers and artificial intelligence.
 <br> </p>
<hr>
 <b style="font-size: 1.3em;">What have I worked on? </b>
 <br>
 With immense vigour, I have worked on a number of interesting projects related to educational technology, development, and personal interests. Learn <a href="write.html">more</a> about them.<br>

 <hr>
 
 <b style="font-size: 1.3em;">What invigorates me?</b>
 <br>

 My favorite leisure activities are badminton and novels. I am a voracious reader of paperbacks and a national-level badminton player. I am fortunate to have found my lifetime passions - badminton and reading at a very young age. Naturally, both were a grand part of my childhood and growing up. While novels of Leo Tolstoy and Harry Potter transported me to a faraway magical world, badminton became my link to the real world. Over the years the struggle of playing competitively in a male-dominated field has helped me realize my feminity and the responsibilities that came with it.<br>
 <br>


 <b>Conclusively, I identify myself as a "thinker" and love science, badminton, and books. I love playing games and conducting "thought experiments" on people's actions and motivations. 
 	<br>
 	I am always up for discussing ideas.
 	<br>
